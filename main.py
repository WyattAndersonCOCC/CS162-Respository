# CS 162
# Project requires TWO functions:

# Returns Area of Rectangle
def rect_area(length, width):
    return length * width

# Returns Surface Area of Rectangular Solid
def surface_area(length, width, height):
    return 2 * (rect_area(length, width) + (height * length) + (height * width))


# Request the dimension of a solid rectangular object
length = int(input("Enter the length of the the object as a integer: "))
width = int(input("Enter the width of the the object as a integer: "))
height = int(input("Enter the height of the the object as a integer: "))

print("Length = ", length, "Width = ", width, "Height = ", height)
print("Total Surface Area = ", str(surface_area(length, width, height)))
print("Area of the rectangle: " + str(rect_area(length, width)))
